Hello, I'm Jiaao Chen!


I am a first-year PhD student in the [School of Interactive Computin](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. My advisor is Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. 



Before coming to Georgia Tech, I obtained my bachelor degree from Zhejiang University. I was previously a student intern at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. [Robert Kraut](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/robert-kraut), and UC Davis working with Prof.[Zhou Yu](http://zhouyu.cs.ucdavis.edu/).
